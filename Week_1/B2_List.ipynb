    "# Python Lists: Implementation and Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**List** is a versatile data structure and the principal data structure in Python. The data processed by a program is most commonly stored in a list, though there are situations where other data structures are preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we take a look at the implementation and properties of the Python list. A particular focus is the **time complexity** of list operations: what operations are efficient and when you should use a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## List in Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory of a computer consists of a sequence of memory locations capable of storing data. Each memory location has an address that can be used for access. When a program is executed, the data it processes is stored in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following Python program as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 7\n",
    "b = -3\n",
    "c = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n",
    "d = 99\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that the variables and the list defined in the program are stored in the memory starting from the address `100`. The following is a simplified illustration of what the contents of the memory might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Address:   100  101  102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110\n",
    "Value:       7   -3    1   2   3   1   2   0   0   0  99\n",
    "Variable:    a    b    c                               d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The contents of the variable `a` are stored in memory location `100`.\n",
    "- The contents of the variable `b` are in location `101`.\n",
    "- The memory locations `102–109` are reserved for the list `c`. Only locations `102–106` are currently in use, as the list has 5 elements.\n",
    "- The variable `d` is in location `110`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of the list are stored in **consecutive memory locations**, which makes it easy to determine the location of a given list element. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `c[2]` is at address `102 + 2 = 104`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list occupies **more memory than currently needed** in preparation for possible addition of new elements. Thus, a list has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Length** (e.g., 5 elements)\n",
    "- **Capacity** (e.g., 8 memory slots)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## List Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in operations for managing lists. Below is an overview of their **time complexities**, assuming the list has `n` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing these complexities helps you design more efficient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(1)**: Constant time, always efficient.\n",
    "- **O(n)**: Linear time, may be slow for large lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "List elements can be accessed or modified using the index operator `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [4, 3, 7, 3, 2]\n",
    "print(numbers[2])  # Output: 7\n",
    "numbers[2] = 5\n",
    "print(numbers[2])  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: **O(1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because elements are in consecutive memory and can be directly accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## List Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The `len()` function returns the number of elements in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [4, 3, 7, 3, 2]\n",
    "print(len(numbers))  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: **O(1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The length is stored in memory alongside the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `in`: checks for membership\n",
    "- `index()`: returns the index of first occurrence\n",
    "- `count()`: counts occurrences\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [4, 3, 7, 3, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(3 in numbers)        # Output: True\n",
    "print(8 in numbers)        # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "print(numbers.index(3))    # Output: 1\n",
    "print(numbers.count(3))    # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: **O(n)**\n",
    "\n",
    "These scan the entire list. For example, `count()` can be implemented like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count(items, target):\n",
    "    result = 0\n",
    "    for item in items:\n",
    "        if item == target:\n",
    "            result += 1\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: These may be fast *on average*, but the worst-case time is still **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding an Element\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `append` adds an element to the end of the list, and the method `insert` adds an element to a given position on the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers.append(5)\n",
    "print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers.insert(1, 6)\n",
    "print(numbers)  # [1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexities of these operations are affected by the way the elements are stored in memory. In this case, the contents of the memory before additions look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107\n",
    "1    2    3    4    0    0    0    0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `append` needs **O(1)** time, because adding an element to the end of a list does not require changes to other memory locations. In the example, the element 5 is stored in the memory location 104:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107\n",
    "1    2    3    4    5    0    0    0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the memory area reserved for the list is already full and there is no room for the new element, a new bigger memory area is reserved and all elements are moved, which takes **O(n)** time. With good implementation, this is rare, so the average time complexity remains **O(1)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `insert` has time complexity **O(n)** because adding an element elsewhere in the list requires shifting elements forward. For example, inserting 6 at index 1 changes memory like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107\n",
    "1    6    2    3    4    5    0    0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`insert` is more efficient near the end of the list as fewer elements need to be moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing an Element\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `pop` removes an element. If called without an argument, it removes the last element. With an index, it removes the element at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers.pop()\n",
    "print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers.pop(1)\n",
    "print(numbers)  # [1, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before removal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107\n",
    "1    2    3    4    5    6    0    0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing the last element (6) takes **O(1)** time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107\n",
    "1    2    3    4    5    0    0    0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing from the middle takes **O(n)** because following elements must shift:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107\n",
    "1    3    4    5    0    0    0    0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has `remove`, which removes the first occurrence of a value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "numbers.remove(3)\n",
    "print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
